# Teaching with Social Justice
I was inspired to try to incorporate best practices into my teaching and I was 
hoping to structure a class (in the future) around social justice topics. 
By doing so I hope to be able to:

1. Make statistics more relevant to all students in the classroom,
2. Force students to make arguments and conclusions based on real data,
3. Give students the opportunity to understand the ethical and moral
   implications of data collection, variable definitions, and modeling
   assumptions, 
4. Create inter-disciplinary opportunities for people to use statistical 
   methods, and
5. Allow students to practice using state-of-the-art software tools to assist 
   with version control, documentation, and group work.

## Pedagogy
I do not have formal training in teaching students, but I can learn how to 
teach well. I would like to incorporate the following:

* [Active Learning](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/teaching-guides/running-your-course/active-learning)
* [Community Learning](https://onehe.org/equity-unbound/)
* Team Based Learning

## TODO

* [ ] Add literature about how to teach statistics
* [ ] Add resources about teaching strategies
* [ ] Add data sets that would be useful for analyzing social outcomes
